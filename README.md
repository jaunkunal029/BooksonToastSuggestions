# BooksonToastSuggestions
A python script which suggests books from the BooksOnToast channel. It also directly opens amazon link so that you can buy the book direclty

The BooksOnToast youtube channel is a very good podcast revolving around books and all things related.
The good folks at BooksOnToast always put up links to the amazon websites for the books that they have discussed in the episode.

At times when I was struggling to find what to read next, I would always surf through their channel and find good books, but 
this would involve going to their YouTube channel, finding the right video and then look at the descsription box was just too much for me.

Having recently learnt Python, I though this would be a good problem to test my skills.

So I did, and here it is. A python script that will randomly pick a book suggestion from the BooksOnToast youtube and open the amazon link
so that you can directly buy the book by just one click.
